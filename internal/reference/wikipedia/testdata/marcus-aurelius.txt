{{Marcus Aurelius}}

'''Marcus Aurelius Antoninus''' ({{IPA-la|ˈmaːrkʊs au̯ˈreːliʊs antoːˈniːnʊs|lang}}; English: {{IPAc-en|ɔː|ˈ|r|iː|l|i|ə|s}} {{respell|aw|REE|lee|əs}};<ref>[https://www.dictionary.com/browse/marcus-aurelius 'Marcus Aurelius'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181228082840/https://www.dictionary.com/browse/marcus-aurelius |date=28 December 2018}}. [[Dictionary.com]].</ref> 26 April 121 – 17 March 180) was [[Roman emperor]] from 161 to 180 AD and a [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher. He was a member of the [[Nerva–Antonine dynasty]], the last of the rulers later known as the [[Five Good Emperors]] and the last emperor of the [[Pax Romana]], an age of relative peace, calm, and stability for the [[Roman Empire]] lasting from 27 BC to 180 AD. He served as [[Roman consul]] in 140, 145, and 161.

Marcus Aurelius was the son of the [[praetor]] [[Marcus Annius Verus&nbsp;(III)|Marcus Annius Verus]] and his wife, [[Domitia Calvilla]]. He was related through marriage to the emperors [[Trajan]] and [[Hadrian]]. Marcus's father died when he was three, and he was raised by his mother and [[Marcus Annius Verus&nbsp;(II)|paternal grandfather]]. After Hadrian's [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adoptive]] son, [[Aelius Caesar]], died in 138, Hadrian adopted Marcus's uncle [[Antoninus Pius]] as his new heir. In turn, Antoninus adopted Marcus and [[Lucius Verus|Lucius]], the son of Aelius. Hadrian died that year, and Antoninus became emperor. Now heir to the throne, Marcus studied Greek and Latin under tutors such as [[Herodes Atticus]] and [[Marcus Cornelius Fronto]]. He married Antoninus's daughter [[Faustina the Younger|Faustina]] in 145.

After Antoninus died in 161, Marcus Aurelius acceded to the throne alongside his adoptive brother, who reigned under the name Lucius Verus. Under [[Reign of Marcus Aurelius|his rule]] the Roman Empire witnessed heavy military conflict. In the East, the Romans [[Parthian war of Lucius Verus|fought successfully]] with a revitalized [[Parthian Empire]] and the rebel [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]. Marcus defeated the [[Marcomanni]], [[Quadi]], and [[Sarmatian]] [[Iazyges]] in the [[Marcomannic Wars]]; however, these and other [[Germanic peoples]] began to represent a troubling reality for the Empire. He reduced the silver purity of the [[Roman currency]], the [[denarius]]. The [[persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire]] appears to have increased during his reign, but his involvement in this is unlikely since there is no record of early Christians in the 2nd century calling him a persecutor, and [[Tertullian]] even called Marcus a "protector of Christians".<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Keresztes |first=Paul |date=July 1968 |title=Marcus Aurelius a Persecutor? |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/harvard-theological-review/article/abs/marcus-aurelius-a-persecutor/E8F76CB327530CF310251FDFCC1ADDF2 |journal=Harvard Theological Review |language=en |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=321–341 |doi=10.1017/S0017816000029230 |s2cid=159950967 |issn=1475-4517}}</ref> The [[Antonine Plague]] broke out in 165 or 166 and devastated the [[population of the Roman Empire]], causing the deaths of five to ten million people. Lucius Verus may have died from the plague in 169.

Unlike some of his predecessors, Marcus chose not to adopt an heir. His children included [[Lucilla]], who married Lucius, and [[Commodus]], whose succession after Marcus has been a subject of debate among both contemporary and modern historians. The [[Column of Marcus Aurelius|Column]] and [[Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius]] still stand in Rome, where they were erected in celebration of his military victories. ''[[Meditations]]'', the writings of "the philosopher" – as contemporary biographers called Marcus – are a significant source of the modern understanding of ancient Stoic philosophy. These writings have been praised by fellow writers, philosophers, monarchs, and politicians centuries after his death.

==Sources==

The major sources depicting the life and rule of Marcus Aurelius are patchy and frequently unreliable. The most important group of sources, the biographies contained in the ''[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]]'', claimed to be written by a group of authors at the turn of the 4th century AD, but it is believed they were in fact written by a single author (referred to here as 'the biographer') from about AD 395.<ref>Rohrbacher, p. 5.</ref> The later biographies and the biographies of subordinate emperors and usurpers are unreliable, but the earlier biographies, derived primarily from now-lost earlier sources ([[Marius Maximus]] or Ignotus), are considered to be more accurate.<ref name='Birley, 1889'>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 229–230. The thesis of single authorship was first proposed in H. Dessau's 'Über Zeit und Persönlichkeit der ''Scriptores Historiae Augustae{{'}}'' (in German), ''Hermes'' 24 (1889), pp. 337ff.</ref> For Marcus's life and rule, the biographies of [[Hadrian]], [[Antoninus Pius|Antoninus]], Marcus, and [[Lucius Verus|Lucius]] are largely reliable, but those of [[Aelius Verus]] and [[Avidius Cassius]] are not.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 230. On the ''HA Verus'', see Barnes, 'Hadrian and Lucius Verus', pp. 65–74.</ref>

A body of correspondence between Marcus's tutor [[Marcus Cornelius Fronto|Fronto]] and various Antonine officials survives in a series of patchy manuscripts, covering the period from c. 138 to 166.<ref>Fleury, P. 2012.

Dio is vital for the military history of the period, but his senatorial prejudices and strong opposition to imperial expansion obscure his perspective.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 228–229, 253.</ref> Some other literary sources provide specific details: the writings of the physician [[Galen]] on the habits of the Antonine elite, the orations of [[Aelius Aristides]] on the temper of the times, and the constitutions preserved in the ''[[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]]'' and ''[[Codex Justinianeus]]'' on Marcus's legal work.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 227–228.</ref> [[Epigraphy|Inscriptions]] and [[numismatics|coin finds]] supplement the literary sources.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 228.</ref>

==Early life==
{{Main|Early life of Marcus Aurelius}}

===Name===
Marcus was born in [[Rome]] on 26 April 121. His birth name is sometimes given as Marcus Annius Verus,<ref>Magill, p. 693.</ref> but sources assign this name to him upon his father's death and unofficial adoption by his grandfather, upon his coming of age.<ref name=dio69.21>[[Cassius Dio]], [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/69*.html#21 Book 69,21.1.] "Marcus Annius Verus [...] This Marcus Annius, earlier named Catilius, was a grandson of [[Marcus Annius Verus (grandfather of Marcus Aurelius)|Annius Verus]] [...] He preferred Verus on account of his kinship and his age and because he was already giving indication of exceptional strength of character.

===Family origins===
Marcus's paternal family was of Roman [[Annia gens#Anni Verii|Italo-Hispanic origins]]. His father was [[Marcus Annius Verus (III)]].<ref name="books.google.com">{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.45180 | page=[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.45180/page/n225 439] | quote=Marcus Aurelius Malennius and Numa. |title = The English Cyclopædia: A New Dictionary of Universal Knowledge.

Marcus's mother, [[Domitia Lucilla Minor]] (also known as Domitia Calvilla), was the daughter of the Roman patrician P. Calvisius Tullus and inherited a great fortune (described at length in one of [[Pliny the Younger|Pliny]]'s letters) from her parents and grandparents. Her inheritance included large brickworks on the outskirts of Rome – a profitable enterprise in an era when the city was experiencing a construction boom – and the ''Horti Domitia Calvillae'' (or ''Lucillae''), a villa on the [[Caelian hill]] of Rome.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 29, citing Pliny, ''Epistulae'' 8.18.</ref><ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 30.</ref> Marcus himself was born and raised in the ''Horti'' and referred to the Caelian hill as 'My Caelian'.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/fronto.html | title=M.

The adoptive family of Marcus was of Roman [[Aurelia gens#Aueli Fulvi|Italo-Gallic origins]]: the [[Aurelia gens|gens Aurelia]], into which Marcus was adopted at the age of 17, was a [[Sabine]] gens; [[Antoninus Pius]], his adoptive father, came from the Aurelii Fulvi, a branch of the Aurelii based in [[Roman Gaul]].

===Childhood===
Marcus's sister, [[Annia Cornificia Faustina]], was probably born in 122 or 123.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 31, 44.</ref> His father probably died in 124, when Marcus was three years old during his praetorship.<ref name='Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 31'>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 31.</ref>{{refn|Farquharson dates his death to 130 when Marcus was nine.<ref>Farquharson, 1.95–96.</ref>|group=note}} Though he can hardly have known his father, Marcus wrote in his ''Meditations'' that he had learned 'modesty and manliness' from his memories of his father and the man's posthumous reputation.<ref>''Meditations'' 1.1, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 31.</ref> His mother Lucilla did not remarry<ref name='Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 31'/> and, following prevailing aristocratic customs, probably did not spend much time with her son. Instead, Marcus was in the care of 'nurses',<ref>''HA Marcus'' ii. 1 and ''Meditations'' v. 4, qtd. in Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 32.</ref> and was raised after his father's death by his grandfather Marcus Annius Verus (II), who had always retained the legal authority of ''[[patria potestas]]'' over his son and grandson. Technically this was not an adoption, the creation of a new and different ''patria potestas''. [[Lucius Catilius Severus]], described as Marcus's maternal great-grandfather, also participated in his upbringing; he was probably the elder Domitia Lucilla's stepfather.<ref name='Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 33'/> Marcus was raised in his parents' home on the [[Caelian Hill]], an upscale area with few public buildings but many aristocratic villas. Marcus's grandfather owned a palace beside the [[Lateran Palace|Lateran]], where he would spend much of his childhood.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 31–32.</ref> Marcus thanks his grandfather for teaching him 'good character and avoidance of bad temper'.<ref>''Meditations'' i. 1, qtd. and tr.

From a young age, Marcus displayed enthusiasm for [[wrestling]] and [[boxing]]. He trained in wrestling as a youth and into his teenage years, learned to fight in armour and joined the [[Salii]], an order of priests dedicated to the god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] that were responsible for the sacred shields, called [[Ancile|Ancilia]], and possibly for heralding war season's beginning and end.

Farquharson, ''The Meditations of Marcus Antoninus'' (Oxford, 1944) ii. 453.</ref>

===Succession to Hadrian===

In late 136, Hadrian almost died from a [[hemorrhage]]. Convalescent in [[Hadrian's Villa|his villa]] at [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]], he selected Lucius Ceionius Commodus, Marcus's intended father-in-law, as his successor and [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adopted son]],<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 41–42.</ref> according to the biographer 'against the wishes of everyone'.<ref>''HA Hadrian'' xiii. 10, qtd. in Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 42.</ref> While his motives are not certain, it would appear that his goal was to eventually place the then-too-young Marcus on the throne.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 42. Van Ackeren, 142. On the succession to Hadrian, see also: T.D. Barnes, 'Hadrian and Lucius Verus', ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 57:1–2 (1967): 65–79; J. VanderLeest, 'Hadrian, Lucius Verus, and the Arco di Portogallo', ''Phoenix'' 49:4 (1995): pp. 319–330.</ref> As part of his adoption, Commodus took the name, Lucius Aelius Caesar. His health was so poor that, during a ceremony to mark his becoming heir to the throne, he was too weak to lift a large shield on his own.<ref>''HA Aelius'' vi. 2–3</ref> After a brief stationing on the [[Danube]] frontier, Aelius returned to Rome to make an address to the Senate on the first day of 138. However, the night before the scheduled speech, he grew ill and died of a hemorrhage later in the day.<ref>''HA Hadrian'' xxiii. 15–16; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 45; 'Hadrian to the Antonines', 148.</ref>{{refn|Commodus was a known consumptive at the time of his adoption, so Hadrian may have intended Marcus's eventual succession anyway.<ref>Dio, lxix.17.1; ''HA Aelius'', iii. 7, iv. 6, vi. 1–7; Birley, 'Hadrian to the Antonines', p. 147.</ref>|group=note}}

On 24 January 138, Hadrian selected Aurelius Antoninus, the husband of Marcus's aunt [[Faustina the Elder]], as his new successor.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 46. Date: Birley, 'Hadrian to the Antonines', p. 148.</ref> As part of Hadrian's terms, Antoninus, in turn, adopted Marcus and Lucius Commodus, the son of Lucius Aelius.<ref>Weigel, Richard D. [http://www.roman-emperors.org/tonypis.htm 'Antoninus Pius (A.D. 138–161)']. Roman Emperors.</ref> Marcus became M. Aelius Aurelius Verus, and Lucius became L. Aelius Aurelius Commodus. At Hadrian's request, Antoninus's daughter Faustina was betrothed to Lucius.<ref>Dio 69.21.1; ''HA Hadrian'' xxiv. 1; ''HA Aelius'' vi. 9; ''HA Antoninus Pius'' iv. 6–7; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 48–49.</ref> Marcus reportedly greeted the news that Hadrian had become his adoptive grandfather with sadness, instead of joy. Only with reluctance did he move from his mother's house on the Caelian to Hadrian's private home.<ref>''HA Marcus'' v. 3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 49.</ref>

At some time in 138, Hadrian requested in the Senate that Marcus be exempt from the law barring him from becoming ''[[quaestor]]'' before his twenty-fourth birthday. The Senate complied, and Marcus served under Antoninus, the consul for 139.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 49–50.</ref> Marcus's adoption diverted him from the typical career path of his class. If not for his adoption, he probably would have become ''[[triumvir monetalis]]'', a highly regarded post involving token administration of the state mint; after that, he could have served as [[military tribune|tribune with a legion]], becoming the legion's nominal second-in-command. Marcus probably would have opted for travel and further education instead. As it was, Marcus was set apart from his fellow citizens. Nonetheless, his biographer attests that his character remained unaffected: 'He still showed the same respect to his relations as he had when he was an ordinary citizen, and he was as thrifty and careful of his possessions as he had been when he lived in a private household'.<ref>''HA Marcus'' v. 6–8, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 50.</ref>

After a series of suicide attempts, all thwarted by Antoninus, Hadrian left for [[Baiae]], a seaside resort on the [[Campania]]n coast. His condition did not improve, and he abandoned the diet prescribed by his doctors, indulging himself in food and drink. He sent for Antoninus, who was at his side when he died on 10 July 138.<ref>Dio 69.22.4; ''HA Hadrian'' xxv. 5–6; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 50–51.

Immediately after Hadrian's death, Antoninus approached Marcus and requested that his marriage arrangements be amended: Marcus's betrothal to [[Ceionia Fabia]] would be annulled, and he would be betrothed to [[Faustina the Younger|Faustina]], Antoninus's daughter, instead. Faustina's betrothal to Ceionia's brother Lucius Commodus would also have to be annulled. Marcus consented to Antoninus's proposal.<ref>''HA Marcus'' vi. 2; ''Verus'' ii. 3–4; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 53–54.</ref> He was made [[Roman consul|consul]] for 140 with Antoninus as his colleague, and was appointed as a ''sevir'', one of the [[Equites|knights]]' six commanders, at the order's annual parade on 15 July 139. As the heir apparent, Marcus became ''princeps iuventutis'', head of the equestrian order. He now took the name Marcus Aelius Aurelius Verus Caesar.<ref>Dio 71.35.5; ''HA Marcus'' vi. 3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 56.</ref> Marcus would later caution himself against taking the name too seriously: 'See that you do not turn into a Caesar; do not be dipped into the [[Tyrian purple|purple dye]] – for that can happen'.<ref>''Meditations'' vi. 30, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 57; cf. ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 270 n.9, with notes on the translation.</ref> At the senate's request, Marcus joined all the priestly colleges (''[[Pontiff|pontifices]]'', ''[[augur]]es'', ''[[quindecimviri sacris faciundis]]'', ''[[Epulones|septemviri epulonum]]'', etc.);<ref name='ReferenceA'>''HA Marcus'' vi. 3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 57.</ref> direct evidence for membership, however, is available only for the [[Arval Brethren]].<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 57, 272 n.10, citing ''Codex Inscriptionum Latinarum'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20120429224044/http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=CIL+06,+00032&r_sortierung=Belegstelle 6.32], [https://web.archive.org/web/20120429224054/http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=CIL+06,+00379&r_sortierung=Belegstelle 6.379], cf.

Antoninus demanded that Marcus reside in the House of Tiberius, the imperial palace on the Palatine, and take up the habits of his new station, the ''aulicum fastigium'' or 'pomp of the court', against Marcus's objections.<ref name='ReferenceA'/> Marcus would struggle to reconcile the life of the court with his philosophic yearnings. He told himself it was an attainable goal – 'Where life is possible, then it is possible to live the right life; life is possible in a palace, so it is possible to live the right life in a palace'<ref>''Meditations'' 5.16, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 57.</ref> – but he found it difficult nonetheless. He would criticize himself in the ''Meditations'' for 'abusing court life' in front of company.<ref>''Meditations'' 8.9, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 57.</ref>

As quaestor, Marcus would have had little real administrative work to do. He would read imperial letters to the senate when Antoninus was absent and would do secretarial work for the senators.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 57–58.</ref> But he felt drowned in paperwork and complained to his tutor, Marcus Cornelius Fronto: 'I am so out of breath from dictating nearly thirty letters'.<ref>''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' iv. 7, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 90.</ref> He was being 'fitted for ruling the state', in the words of his biographer.<ref>''HA Marcus'' vi. 5; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 58.</ref> He was required to make a speech to the assembled senators as well, making oratorical training essential for the job.<ref name='Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 89'>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 89.</ref>

On 1 January 145, Marcus was made consul a second time. Fronto urged him in a letter to have plenty of sleep 'so that you may come into the Senate with a good colour and read your speech with a strong voice'.<ref>''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' v. 1, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 89.</ref> Marcus had complained of an illness in an earlier letter: 'As far as my strength is concerned, I am beginning to get it back; and there is no trace of the pain in my chest. But that ulcer [...]{{refn|The manuscript is corrupt here.<ref name='Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 89'/>|group=note}} I am having treatment and taking care not to do anything that interferes with it'.<ref>''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' 4.8, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 89.</ref> Never particularly healthy or strong, Marcus was praised by Cassius Dio, writing of his later years, for behaving dutifully in spite of his various illnesses.<ref>Dio 71.36.3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 89.</ref> In April 145, Marcus married Faustina, legally his sister, as had been planned since 138.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 90–91.</ref> Little is specifically known of the ceremony, but the biographer calls it 'noteworthy'.<ref>''HA Antoninus Pius'' x. 2, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 91.</ref> Coins were issued with the heads of the couple, and Antoninus, as ''[[Pontifex Maximus]]'', would have officiated. Marcus makes no apparent reference to the marriage in his surviving letters, and only sparing references to Faustina.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 91.</ref>

===Fronto and further education===
After taking the ''[[toga virilis]]'' in 136, Marcus probably began his training in [[Eloquence|oratory]].<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 61.</ref> He had three tutors in [[Greek language|Greek]] (Aninus Macer, Caninius Celer, and [[Herodes Atticus]]) and one in Latin ([[Marcus Cornelius Fronto]]). The latter two were the most esteemed orators of their time,<ref>''HA Marcus'' iii. 6; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 62.</ref> but probably did not become his tutors until his adoption by Antoninus in 138. The preponderance of Greek tutors indicates the importance of the Greek language to the aristocracy of Rome.<ref>''HA Marcus'' ii. 4; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 62.</ref> This was the age of the [[Second Sophistic]], a renaissance in Greek letters. Although educated in Rome, in his ''[[Meditations]]'' Marcus would write his inmost thoughts in Greek.<ref>Alan Cameron, review of Anthony Birley's ''Marcus Aurelius'', ''Classical Review'' 17:3 (1967): p. 347.</ref>

Atticus was controversial: an enormously rich Athenian (probably the richest man in the eastern half of the empire), he was quick to anger and resented by his fellow Athenians for his patronizing manner.<ref>''Vita Sophistae'' 2.1.14; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 63–64.</ref> Atticus was an inveterate opponent of [[Stoicism]] and philosophic pretensions.<ref>[[Aulus Gellius]], ''[[Noctes Atticae]]'' 9.2.1–7; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 64–65.</ref> He thought the Stoics' desire for [[apatheia]] was foolish: they would live a 'sluggish, enervated life', he said.<ref>[[Aulus Gellius]], ''[[Noctes Atticae]]'' 19.12, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 65.</ref> In spite of the influence of Atticus, Marcus would later become a Stoic. He would not mention Herodes at all in his ''Meditations'', in spite of the fact that they would come into contact many times over the following decades.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 65.</ref>

Fronto was highly esteemed: in the self-consciously antiquarian world of Latin letters,<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 67–68, citing Champlin, ''Fronto and Antonine Rome'', esp. chs. 3 and 4.</ref> he was thought of as second only to [[Cicero]], perhaps even an alternative to him.<ref name='ReferenceB'>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 65–67.</ref>{{refn|Modern scholars have not offered as positive an assessment. His second modern editor, [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr|Niebhur]], thought him stupid and frivolous; his third editor, [[Samuel Adrian Naber|Naber]], found him contemptible.<ref>Champlin, ''Fronto'', pp. 1–2.</ref> Historians have seen him as a 'pedant and a bore', his letters offering neither the running political analysis of a Cicero or the conscientious reportage of a Pliny.<ref>Mellor, p. 460.</ref> Recent prosopographic research has rehabilitated his reputation, though not by much.<ref>Cf., e.g.: Mellor, p. 461 and ''passim''.</ref>|group=note}} He did not care much for Atticus, though Marcus was eventually to put the pair on speaking terms. Fronto exercised a complete mastery of Latin, capable of tracing expressions through the literature, producing obscure [[synonym]]s, and challenging minor improprieties in word choice.<ref name='ReferenceB'/>

A significant amount of the correspondence between Fronto and Marcus has survived.<ref name='Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 69'>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 69.</ref> The pair were very close, using intimate language such as 'Farewell my Fronto, wherever you are, my most sweet love and delight. How is it between you and me? I love you and you are not here' in their correspondence.<ref>''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' iv. 6 (= Haines 1.80ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 76.</ref> Marcus spent time with Fronto's wife and daughter, both named Cratia, and they enjoyed light conversation.<ref>''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' iv. 6 (= Haines 1.80ff); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 76–77.</ref>

He wrote Fronto a letter on his birthday, claiming to love him as he loved himself, and calling on the gods to ensure that every word he learnt of literature, he would learn 'from the lips of Fronto'.<ref>''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' iii. 10–11 (= Haines 1.50ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 73.</ref> His prayers for Fronto's health were more than conventional, because Fronto was frequently ill; at times, he seems to be an almost constant invalid, always suffering<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 73.</ref> – about one-quarter of the surviving letters deal with the man's sicknesses.<ref>Champlin, 'Chronology of Fronto', p. 138.</ref> Marcus asks that Fronto's pain be inflicted on himself, 'of my own accord with every kind of discomfort'.<ref>''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' v. 74 ( =Haines 2.52ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 73.</ref>

Fronto never became Marcus's full-time teacher and continued his career as an advocate. One notorious case brought him into conflict with Atticus.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 77. On the date, see Champlin, 'Chronology of Fronto', p. 142, who (with Bowersock, ''Greek Sophists in the Roman Empire'' (1964), 93ff) argues for a date in the 150s; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 78–79, 273 n.17 (with Ameling, ''Herodes Atticus'' (1983), 1.61ff, 2.30ff) argues for 140.</ref> Marcus pleaded with Fronto, first with 'advice', then as a 'favour', not to attack Atticus; he had already asked Atticus to refrain from making the first blows.<ref>''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' iii. 2 (= Haines 1.58ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 77–78.</ref> Fronto replied that he was surprised to discover Marcus counted Atticus as a friend (perhaps Atticus was not yet Marcus's tutor), and allowed that Marcus might be correct,<ref>''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' iii. 3 (= Haines 1.62ff); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 78.</ref> but nonetheless affirmed his intent to win the case by any means necessary: '[T]he charges are frightful and must be spoken of as frightful. Those in particular that refer to the beating and robbing I will describe so that they savour of gall and bile. If I happen to call him an uneducated little Greek it will not mean war to the death'.<ref>''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' iii. 3 (= Haines 1.62ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 79.</ref> The outcome of the trial is unknown.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 80.</ref>

By the age of twenty-five (between April 146 and April 147), Marcus had grown disaffected with his studies in [[jurisprudence]], and showed some signs of general [[malaise]]. His master, he writes to Fronto, was an unpleasant blowhard, and had made 'a hit at' him: 'It is easy to sit yawning next to a judge, he says, but to ''be'' a judge is noble work'.<ref>''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' iv. 13 (= Haines 1.214ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 93.</ref> Marcus had grown tired of his exercises, of taking positions in imaginary debates. When he criticized the insincerity of conventional language, Fronto took to defend it.<ref>''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' iv. 3.1 (= Haines 1.2ff); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 94.</ref> In any case, Marcus's formal education was now over. He had kept his teachers on good terms, following them devotedly. It 'affected his health adversely', his biographer writes, to have devoted so much effort to his studies. It was the only thing the biographer could find fault with in Marcus's entire boyhood.<ref>''HA Marcus'' iii. 5–8, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 94.</ref>

Fronto had warned Marcus against the study of philosophy early on: "It is better never to have touched the teaching of philosophy [...] than to have tasted it superficially, with the edge of the lips, as the saying is".<ref>''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' iv. 3, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 69.</ref> He disdained philosophy and philosophers and looked down on Marcus's sessions with [[Apollonius of Chalcedon]] and others in this circle.<ref name='Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 69'/> Fronto put an uncharitable interpretation of Marcus's 'conversion to philosophy': 'In the fashion of the young, tired of boring work', Marcus had turned to philosophy to escape the constant exercises of oratorical training.<ref>''De Eloquentia'' iv. 5 (= Haines 2.74), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 95. Alan Cameron, in his review of Birley's biography (''The Classical Review'' 17:3 (1967): p. 347), suggests a reference to chapter 11 of Arthur Darby Nock's ''Conversion'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1933, rept. 1961): 'Conversion to Philosophy'.</ref> Marcus kept in close touch with Fronto, but would ignore Fronto's scruples.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 94, 105.</ref>

Apollonius may have introduced Marcus to Stoic philosophy, but [[Junius Rusticus|Quintus Junius Rusticus]] would have the strongest influence on the boy.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 95; Champlin, ''Fronto'', p. 120.</ref>{{refn|Champlin notes that Marcus's praise of Rusticus in the ''Meditations'' is out of order (he is praised immediately after Diognetus, who had introduced Marcus to philosophy), giving him special emphasis.<ref>Champlin, ''Fronto'', p. 174 n. 12.</ref>|group=note}} He was the man Fronto recognized as having 'wooed Marcus away' from oratory.<ref>''Ad Antoninum Imperatorem'' i.2.2 (= Haines 2.36), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 95.</ref> He was older than Fronto and twenty years older than Marcus. As the grandson of [[Arulenus Rusticus]], one of the martyrs to the tyranny of [[Domitian]] (''r''. 81–96), he was heir to the tradition of '[[Stoic Opposition]]' to the 'bad emperors' of the 1st century;<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 94–95, 101.</ref> the true successor of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] (as opposed to Fronto, the false one).<ref>Champlin, ''Fronto'', p. 120.</ref> Marcus thanks Rusticus for teaching him 'not to be led astray into enthusiasm for rhetoric, for writing on speculative themes, for discoursing on moralizing texts.... To avoid oratory, poetry, and 'fine writing'<nowiki/>'.<ref>''Meditations'' i.7, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 94–95.</ref>

[[Philostratus]] describes how even when Marcus was an old man, in the latter part of his reign, he studied under [[Sextus of Chaeronea]]:
<blockquote>The Emperor Marcus was an eager disciple of Sextus the [[Boeotia]]n philosopher, being often in his company and frequenting his house. Lucius, who had just come to Rome, asked the Emperor, whom he met on his way, where he was going to and on what errand, and Marcus answered, ' it is good even for an old man to learn; I am now on my way to Sextus the philosopher to learn what I do not yet know.' And Lucius, raising his hand to heaven, said, ' O Zeus, the king of the Romans in his old age takes up his [[wax tablet|tablets]] and goes to school.'<ref>Philostratus, ''Vitae sophistorum'' ii. 9 (557); cf. Suda, ''Markos''</ref></blockquote>

===Birth and death===
On 30 November 147, Faustina gave birth to a girl named Domitia Faustina. She was the first of at least thirteen children (including two sets of twins) that Faustina would bear over the next twenty-three years. The next day, 1 December, Antoninus gave Marcus the [[tribune|tribunician]] power and the ''[[imperium]]'' – authority over the armies and provinces of the emperor. As tribune, he had the right to bring one measure before the senate after the four Antoninus could introduce. His tribunician powers would be renewed with Antoninus's on 10 December 147.<ref name='Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 103'>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 103.</ref> The first mention of Domitia in Marcus's letters reveals her as a sickly infant. 'Caesar to Fronto. If the gods are willing we seem to have a hope of recovery. The diarrhea has stopped, the little attacks of fever have been driven away. But the emaciation is still extreme and there is still quite a bit of coughing'. He and Faustina, Marcus wrote, had been 'pretty occupied' with the girl's care.<ref>''Ad Marcum Caesarem'' 4.11 (= Haines 1.202ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 105.</ref> Domitia would die in 151.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 247 F.1.</ref>

[[File:RomaCastelSantAngelo-2.jpg|thumb|The [[Mausoleum of Hadrian]], where the children of Marcus and Faustina were buried|alt=Mausoleum of Hadrian]]

In 149, Faustina gave birth again, to twin sons. Contemporary coinage commemorates the event, with crossed cornucopiae beneath portrait busts of the two small boys, and the legend ''temporum felicitas'', 'the happiness of the times'. They did not survive long. Before the end of the year, another family coin was issued: it shows only a tiny girl, Domitia Faustina, and one boy baby. Then another: the girl alone. The infants were buried in the [[Castel Sant'Angelo|Mausoleum of Hadrian]], where their epitaphs survive. They were called Titus Aurelius Antoninus and Tiberius Aelius Aurelius.<ref name='Birley, Marcus Aurelius, pp. 106–07'>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 206–207.</ref> Marcus steadied himself: 'One man prays: 'How I may not lose my little child', but you must pray: 'How I may not be afraid to lose him'.<ref>''Meditations'' ix.40, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 207.</ref> He quoted from the ''[[Iliad]]'' what he called the "briefest and most familiar saying [...] enough to dispel sorrow and fear":<ref name="Meditations x pp. 78, 224">''Meditations'' x.34, tr.

–&nbsp;''Iliad'' vi.146<ref name="Meditations x pp. 78, 224"/></blockquote>

Another daughter was born on 7 March 150, [[Lucilla|Annia Aurelia Galeria Lucilla]]. At some time between 155 and 161, probably soon after 155, Marcus's mother Domitia Lucilla died.<ref name='Birley, Marcus Aurelius, 107'>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 107.</ref> Faustina probably had another daughter in 151, but the child, [[Annia Galeria Aurelia Faustina]], might not have been born until 153.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 107–108.</ref> Another son, Tiberius Aelius Antoninus, was born in 152. A coin issue celebrates ''fecunditati Augustae'', 'to Augusta's fertility', depicting two girls and an infant. The boy did not survive long, as evidenced by coins from 156, only depicting the two girls. He might have died in 152, the same year as Marcus's sister Cornificia.<ref name='Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 108'>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 108.</ref> By 28 March 158, when Marcus replied, another of his children was dead. Marcus thanked the temple synod, 'even though this turned out otherwise'. The child's name is unknown.<ref>''Inscriptiones Graecae ad Res Romanas pertinentes'' 4.1399, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 114.</ref> In 159 and 160, Faustina gave birth to daughters: Fadilla and Cornificia, named respectively after Faustina's and Marcus's dead sisters.<ref name='Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 114'>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 114.</ref>

===Antoninus Pius's last years===
[[File:Imperator Antoninus Pius.jpg|thumb|left|Bust of [[Antoninus Pius]], [[British Museum]]]]

In 156, Antoninus turned 70. He found it difficult to keep himself upright without [[corset|stays]]. He started nibbling on dry bread to give him the strength to stay awake through his morning receptions. As Antoninus aged, Marcus would take on more administrative duties, more still when he became the [[praetorian prefect]] (an office that was as much secretarial as military) when Marcus Gavius Maximus died in 156 or 157.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 112.</ref> In 160, Marcus and Lucius were designated joint consuls for the following year. Antoninus may have already been ill.<ref name='Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 114'/>

Two days before his death, the biographer reports, Antoninus was at his ancestral estate at [[Lorium]], in [[Etruria]],<ref>Bowman, 156; Victor, 15:7</ref> about 19 kilometres (12&nbsp;mi) from Rome.<ref name='Victor, 15:7'>Victor, 15:7</ref> He ate Alpine cheese at dinner quite greedily.

===Accession of Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus (161)===

After Antoninus died in 161, Marcus was effectively sole ruler of the Empire. The formalities of the position would follow. The Senate would soon grant him the name Augustus and the title ''[[imperator]]'', and he would soon be formally elected as ''[[pontifex maximus]]'', chief priest of the official cults. Marcus made some show of resistance: the biographer writes that he was 'compelled' to take imperial power.<ref>''HA Marcus'' vii. 5, qtd. and tr.

Birley takes the phrase ''horror imperii'' from ''HA Pert''. xiii. 1 and xv. 8.</ref>

Although Marcus showed no personal affection for [[Hadrian]] (significantly, he does not thank him in the first book of his ''[[Meditations]]''), he presumably believed it his duty to enact the man's succession plans.<ref>Birley, 'Hadrian to the Antonines', p. 156.</ref> Thus, although the Senate planned to confirm Marcus alone, he refused to take office unless Lucius received equal powers.<ref>''HA Verus'' iii.8; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 116; 'Hadrian to the Antonines', p. 156.</ref> The Senate accepted, granting Lucius the ''imperium'', the tribunician power, and the title [[Augustus (title)|Augustus]].<ref>''HA Verus'' iv.1; ''Marcus'' vii.5; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 116.</ref> Marcus became, in official titulature, Imperator Caesar Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus; Lucius, forgoing his name Commodus and taking Marcus's family name Verus, became Imperator Caesar Lucius Aurelius Verus Augustus.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 116–117.</ref>{{refn|These name-swaps have proven so confusing that even the ''Historia Augusta'', our main source for the period, cannot keep them straight.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 117; 'Hadrian to the Antonines', p. 157 n.53.</ref> The 4th-century ecclesiastical historian [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] shows even more confusion.<ref>Birley, 'Hadrian to the Antonines', p. 157 n.53.</ref> The mistaken belief that Lucius had the name 'Verus' before becoming emperor has proven especially popular.<ref name='Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 117'>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 117.</ref>|group=note}} It was the first time that Rome was ruled by two emperors.<ref name='Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 117'/>{{refn|There was, however, much precedent.

In spite of their nominal equality, Marcus held more ''[[auctoritas]]'', or 'authority', than Lucius.

Immediately after their Senate confirmation, the emperors proceeded to the [[Castra Praetoria]], the camp of the [[Praetorian Guard]]. Lucius addressed the assembled troops, which then acclaimed the pair as ''imperatores''. Then, like every new emperor since [[Claudius]], Lucius promised the troops a special ''[[donativum]]''.<ref>''HA Marcus'' vii. 9; ''Verus'' iv.3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 117–118.</ref> This [[wikt:donative|donative]], however, was twice the size of those past: 20,000 [[Sestertius|sesterces]] (5,000 [[Denarius|denarii]]) per capita, with more to officers.

Antoninus's funeral ceremonies were, in the words of the biographer, 'elaborate'.<ref>''HA Marcus'' vii. 10, tr. Magie, cited in Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 118, 278 n.6.</ref> If his funeral followed those of his predecessors, his body would have been cremated on a pyre at the [[Campus Martius]], and his spirit would have been seen as ascending to the gods' home in the heavens. Marcus and Lucius nominated their father for deification. In contrast to their behaviour during Antoninus's campaign to deify Hadrian, the Senate did not oppose the emperors' wishes. A ''[[flamen]]'', or cultic priest, was appointed to minister the cult of the deified Divus Antoninus. Antoninus's remains were laid to rest in [[Castel Sant'Angelo|Hadrian's mausoleum]], beside the remains of Marcus's children and of Hadrian himself.<ref>''HA Marcus'' vii. 10–11; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 118.</ref> The temple he had dedicated to his wife, Diva Faustina, became the [[Temple of Antoninus and Faustina]].

In accordance with his will, Antoninus's fortune passed on to Faustina.<ref>''HA Antoninus Pius'' xii.8; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 118–119.</ref> (Marcus had little need of his wife's fortune.

===Early rule===
Soon after the emperor's accession, Marcus's eleven-year-old daughter, Annia Lucilla, was betrothed to Lucius (in spite of the fact that he was, formally, her uncle).<ref>''HA Marcus'' vii. 7; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 118.</ref> At the ceremonies commemorating the event, new provisions were made for the support of poor children, along the lines of earlier imperial foundations.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 118, citing Werner Eck, ''Die Organization Italiens'' (1979), pp. 146ff.</ref> Marcus and Lucius proved popular with the people of Rome, who strongly approved of their ''civiliter'' ("lacking pomp") behaviour. The emperors permitted free speech, evidenced by the fact that the comedy writer Marullus was able to criticize them without suffering retribution. As the biographer wrote, "No one missed the lenient ways of Pius".<ref>''HA Marcus'' viii. 1, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 119; 'Hadrian to the Antonines', p. 157.</ref>

Marcus replaced a number of the empire's major officials. The ''[[ab epistulis]]'' Sextus Caecilius Crescens Volusianus, in charge of the imperial correspondence, was replaced with Titus Varius Clemens. Clemens was from the frontier province of [[Pannonia]] and had served in the war in [[Mauretania]]. Recently, he had served as procurator of five provinces. He was a man suited for a time of military crisis.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 122–123, citing H.G. Pfalum, ''Les carrières procuratoriennes équestres sous le Haut-Empire romain'' I–III (Paris, 1960–61); ''Supplément'' (Paris, 1982), nos. 142; 156; Eric Birley, ''Roman Britain and the Roman Army'' (1953), pp. 142ff., 151ff.</ref> Lucius Volusius Maecianus, Marcus's former tutor, had been [[Augustal prefect|prefectural governor]] of [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]] at Marcus's accession. Maecianus was recalled, made senator, and appointed prefect of the treasury (''[[aerarium Saturni]]''). He was made consul soon after.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 123, citing H.G. Pfalum, ''Les carrières procuratoriennes équestres sous le Haut-Empire romain'' I–III (Paris, 1960–61); ''Supplément'' (Paris, 1982), no. 141.</ref> Fronto's son-in-law, [[Gaius Aufidius Victorinus]], was appointed governor of [[Germania Superior]].<ref name='HA Marcus 8 1985'>''HA Marcus'' viii. 8; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 123, citing W. Eck, ''Die Satthalter der germ. Provinzen'' (1985), pp. 65ff.</ref>

Fronto returned to his Roman townhouse at dawn on 28 March, having left his home in [[Cirta]] as soon as news of his pupils' accession reached him. He sent a note to the imperial freedman Charilas, asking if he could call on the emperors. Fronto would later explain that he had not dared to write the emperors directly.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 120, citing ''Ad Verum Imperatorem'' i.3.2 (= Haines 1.298ff).</ref> The tutor was immensely proud of his students. Reflecting on the speech he had written on taking his consulship in 143, when he had praised the young Marcus, Fronto was ebullient: "There was then an outstanding natural ability in you; there is now perfected excellence. There was then a crop of growing corn; there is now a ripe, gathered harvest. What I was hoping for then, I have now. The hope has become a reality".<ref>''Ad Antoninum Imperatorem'' iv.2.3 (= Haines 1.302ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 119.</ref> Fronto called on Marcus alone; neither thought to invite Lucius.<ref name='Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 120'>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 120.</ref>

Lucius was less esteemed by Fronto than his brother, as his interests were on a lower level. Lucius asked Fronto to adjudicate in a dispute he and his friend Calpurnius were having on the relative merits of two actors.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 120, citing ''Ad Verum Imperatorem'' i.1 (= Haines 1.305).</ref> Marcus told Fronto of his reading – [[Lucius Coelius Antipater|Coelius]] and a little Cicero – and his family. His daughters were in Rome with their great-great-aunt Matidia; Marcus thought the evening air of the country was too cold for them. He asked Fronto for 'some particularly eloquent reading matter, something of your own, or Cato, or Cicero, or Sallust or Gracchus – or some poet, for I need distraction, especially in this kind of way, by reading something that will uplift and diffuse my pressing anxieties.'<ref>''Ad Antoninum Imperatorem'' iv.1 (= Haines 1.300ff), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 120.</ref> Marcus's early reign proceeded smoothly; he was able to give himself wholly to philosophy and the pursuit of popular affection.<ref>''HA Marcus'' viii. 3–4; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 120.</ref> Soon, however, he would find he had many anxieties. It would mean the end of the ''felicitas temporum'' ('happy times') that the coinage of 161 had proclaimed.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 120, citing H. Mattingly, ''Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum IV: Antoninus Pius to Commodus'' (London, 1940), Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, nos. 841; 845.</ref>

Fronto's letters continued through Marcus's early reign. Fronto felt that, because of Marcus's prominence and public duties, lessons were more important now than they had ever been before. He believed Marcus was 'beginning to feel the wish to be eloquent once more, in spite of having for a time lost interest in eloquence'.<ref>''Ad Antoninum Imperatorem'' 1.2.2 (= Haines 2.35), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 128.</ref> Fronto would again remind his pupil of the tension between his role and his philosophic pretensions: 'Suppose, Caesar, that you can attain to the wisdom of [[Cleanthes]] and [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]], yet, against your will, not the philosopher's woolen cape'.<ref>''De eloquentia'' 1.12 (= Haines 2.63–65), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 128.</ref>

The early days of Marcus's reign were the happiest of Fronto's life: Marcus was beloved by the people of Rome, an excellent emperor, a fond pupil, and perhaps most importantly, as eloquent as could be wished.<ref>''Ad Antoninum Imperatorem'' 1.2.2 (= Haines 2.35); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 127–128.</ref> Marcus had displayed rhetorical skill in his speech to the senate after an earthquake at [[Cyzicus]]. It had conveyed the drama of the disaster, and the Senate had been awed: "Not more suddenly or violently was the city stirred by the earthquake than the minds of your hearers by your speech". Fronto was hugely pleased.<ref>''Ad Antoninum Imperatorem'' 1.2.4 (= Haines 2.41–43), tr. Haines; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 128.</ref>

Fronto sent Marcus a selection of reading material,<ref>''De bello Parthico'' x. (= Haines 2.31), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 127.</ref> and, to settle his unease over the course of the Parthian war, a long and considered letter, full of historical references. In modern editions of Fronto's works, it is labeled ''De bello Parthico'' (''On the Parthian War''). There had been reverses in Rome's past, Fronto writes,<ref>''De bello Parthico'' i–ii. (= Haines 2.21–23).</ref> but in the end, Romans had always prevailed over their enemies: 'Always and everywhere [Mars] has changed our troubles into successes and our terrors into triumphs'.<ref>''De bello Parthico'' i. (= Haines 2.21), qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 127.</ref>

Over the winter of 161–162, news that a rebellion was brewing in Syria arrived and it was decided that Lucius should direct the Parthian war in person. He was stronger and healthier than Marcus, the argument went, and thus more suited to military activity.<ref>Dio, lxxi. 1.3; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 123.</ref> Lucius's biographer suggests ulterior motives: to restrain Lucius's debaucheries, to make him thrifty, to reform his morals by the terror of war, and to realize that he was an emperor.<ref>''HA Verus'' v. 8; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 123, 125.</ref>{{refn|Birley believes there is some truth in these considerations.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 125.</ref>|group=note}} Whatever the case, the senate gave its assent, and, in the summer of 162, Lucius left.

Occupied Armenia was reconstructed on Roman terms.

In 163, the Parthians intervened in [[Osroene]], a Roman client in upper Mesopotamia centred on [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], and installed their own king on its throne.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', pp. 130, 279 n. 38; 'Hadrian to the Antonines', p. 163, citing ''Prosopographia Imperii Romani''<sup>2</sup> M 169; Millar, ''Near East'', p. 112.</ref> In response, Roman forces were moved downstream, to cross the [[Euphrates]] at a more southerly point.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 130; 'Hadrian to the Antonines', p. 162.</ref> Before the end of 163, however, Roman forces had moved north to occupy Dausara and Nicephorium on the northern, Parthian bank.<ref>Fronto, ''Ad Verum Imperatorem'' ii.1.3 (= Haines 2.133); Astarita, 41; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 130; 'Hadrian to the Antonines', p. 162.</ref> Soon after the conquest of the north bank of the Euphrates, other Roman forces moved on Osroene from Armenia, taking Anthemusia, a town southwest of Edessa.<ref>''Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20120429223856/http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=D+01098&r_sortierung=Belegstelle 1098]; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 130.</ref>

In 165, Roman forces moved on Mesopotamia. Edessa was re-occupied, and Mannus, the king deposed by the Parthians, was re-installed.<ref>Birley, 'Hadrian to the Antonines', p. 163, citing ''Prosopographia Imperii Romani''<sup>2</sup> M 169.</ref> The Parthians retreated to Nisibis, but this too was besieged and captured.

By the end of the year, Cassius's army had reached the twin metropolises of Mesopotamia: [[Seleucia]] on the right bank of the Tigris and [[Ctesiphon]] on the left. Ctesiphon was taken and its royal palace set to flame. The citizens of Seleucia, still largely Greek (the city had been commissioned and settled as a capital of the [[Seleucid Empire]], one of [[Alexander the Great]]'s [[Diadochi|successor kingdoms]]), opened its gates to the invaders. The city was sacked nonetheless, leaving a black mark on Lucius's reputation. Excuses were sought, or invented: the official version had it that the Seleucids broke faith first.<ref>''HA Verus'' 8.3–4; Birley, 'Hadrian to the Antonines', 163. Birley cites R.H. McDowell, ''Coins from Seleucia on the Tigris'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1935), pp. 124ff., on the date.</ref>

Cassius's army, although suffering from a shortage of supplies and the effects of a plague contracted in Seleucia, made it back to Roman territory safely.<ref>Birley, 'Hadrian to the Antonines', p. 164.</ref> Lucius took the title Parthicus Maximus, and he and Marcus were hailed as ''imperatores'' again, earning the title 'imp.

Marcus took the Parthicus Maximus now, after another tactful delay.<ref>Birley, 'Hadrian to the Antonines', p. 164, citing H. Mattingly, ''Coins of the Roman Empire in the British Museum IV: Antoninus Pius to Commodus'' (London, 1940), Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, nos. 401ff.</ref> On 12 October of that year, Marcus proclaimed two of his sons, [[Marcus Annius Verus Caesar|Annius]] and [[Commodus]], as [[Caesar (title)|his heirs]].<ref name='auto'>Adams, p. 94.</ref>

During the early 160s, Fronto's son-in-law Victorinus was stationed as a legate in Germany. He was there with his wife and children (another child had stayed with Fronto and his wife in Rome).<ref>Dio 72.11.3–4; ''Ad amicos'' 1.12 (= Haines 2.173); Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 132.</ref> The condition on the northern frontier looked grave. A frontier post had been destroyed, and it looked like all the peoples of central and northern Europe were in turmoil. There was corruption among the officers: Victorinus had to ask for the resignation of a [[legionary]] legate who was taking bribes.<ref>Dio, lxxii. 11.3–4; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 132, citing ''De nepote amisso'' ii (= Haines 2.222); ''Ad Verum Imperatorem'' ii. 9–10 (= Haines 2.232ff.).</ref>

Experienced governors had been replaced by friends and relatives of the imperial family. [[Lucius Dasumius Tullius Tuscus]], a distant relative of Hadrian, was in Upper Pannonia, succeeding the experienced [[Marcus Nonius Macrinus]]. Lower Pannonia was under the obscure [[Tiberius Haterius Saturnius]]. [[Marcus Servilius Fabianus Maximus]] was shuffled from Lower Moesia to Upper Moesia when [[Marcus Iallius Bassus]] had joined Lucius in Antioch. Lower Moesia was filled by Pontius Laelianus's son. The Dacias were still divided in three, governed by a praetorian senator and two procurators. The peace could not hold long; Lower Pannonia did not even have a legion.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 133, citing Geza Alföldy, ''Konsulat und Senatorenstand'' (1977), Moesia Inferior: pp. 232ff.; Moesia Superior: pp. 234ff.; Pannonia Superior: pp. 236ff.; Dacia: pp. 245ff.; Pannonia Inferior: p. 251.</ref>

Starting in the 160s, [[Germanic tribes]], and other nomadic people launched raids along the [[limes Germanicus|northern border]], particularly into [[Gaul]] and across the [[Danube#History|Danube]]. This new impetus westwards was probably due to attacks from tribes further east. A first invasion by the Chatti in the province of Germania Superior was repulsed in 162.<ref name='McLynn2010'>McLynn, ''Marcus Aurelius: A Life'', pp. 323–324.</ref>

Far more dangerous was the invasion of 166, when the [[Marcomanni]] of Bohemia, clients of the Roman Empire since AD 19, crossed the Danube together with the [[Lombards]] and other Germanic tribes.<ref name='Bohec2013'>Le Bohec, p. 56.</ref> Soon thereafter, the Iranian [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] [[Iazyges]] attacked between the Danube and the [[Tisza|Theiss]] rivers.<ref name='Grant2016'>Grant, ''The Antonines: The Roman Empire in Transition'', p. 29.</ref>

The [[Costoboci]], coming from the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] area, invaded [[Moesia]], [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], and Greece. After a long struggle, Marcus managed to push back the invaders. Numerous members of Germanic tribes settled in frontier regions like [[Dacia]], Pannonia, Germany, and Italy itself. This was not a new thing, but this time the numbers of settlers required the creation of two new frontier provinces on the left shore of the Danube, Sarmatia and [[Marcomannia]], including today's [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Hungary]]. Some Germanic tribes who settled in [[Ravenna]] revolted and managed to seize possession of the city. For this reason, Marcus decided not only against bringing more barbarians into Italy, but even banished those who had previously been brought there.<ref>Dio, lxxii.11.4–5; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 253.</ref>

===Legal and administrative work===

Like many emperors, Marcus spent most of his time addressing matters of law such as petitions and hearing disputes,<ref>Fergus Millar, ''The Emperor in the Roman World, 31 BC&nbsp;–&nbsp;AD 337'' (London: Duckworth, 1977), 6 and ''passim''. See also: idem. 'Emperors at Work', ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 57:1/2 (1967): 9–19.</ref> but unlike many of his predecessors, he was already proficient in imperial administration when he assumed power.<ref>[http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-marcus-aurelius.htm 'Thinkers At War – Marcus Aurelius']. [http://www.military-history.org ''Military History Monthly''], published 2014. (This is the conclusion of [[Iain King]]'s biography of Marcus Aurelius.) 'Pius, one of longest-serving emperors, became infirm in his last years, so Marcus Aurelius gradually assumed the imperial duties. By the time he succeeded in AD 161, he was already well-practised in public administration.'</ref> He took great care in the theory and practice of legislation. Professional jurists called him "an emperor most skilled in the law"<ref>''Codex Justinianeus'' 7.2.6, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 133.</ref> and "a most prudent and conscientiously just emperor".<ref>''Digest'' 31.67.10, qtd. and tr. Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 133.</ref> He showed marked interest in three areas of the law: the [[manumission]] of slaves, the guardianship of orphans and minors, and the choice of city councillors (''decuriones'').<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', p. 133.</ref>

Marcus showed a great deal of respect to the Roman Senate and routinely asked them for permission to spend money even though he did not need to do so as the absolute ruler of the Empire.<ref>Irvine, pp. 57–58.</ref> In one speech, Marcus himself reminded the Senate that the imperial palace where he lived was not truly his possession but theirs.<ref>Dio, lxxii.33</ref> In 168, he revalued the denarius, increasing the silver purity from 79% to 82% – the actual silver weight increasing from {{cvt|2.57–2.67|g|oz}}. However, two years later he reverted to the previous values because of the military crises facing the empire.<ref name='TulaneUniversity'/>

====Trade with Han China and outbreak of plague====
{{main|Sino-Roman relations|Antonine Plague}}
A possible contact with [[Han Dynasty|Han China]] occurred in 166 when a [[Sino-Roman relations|Roman traveller visited the Han court]], claiming to be an ambassador representing a certain Andun ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: [[wikt:安|安]] [[wikt:敦|敦]]), ruler of [[Daqin]], who can be identified either with Marcus or his predecessor Antoninus.<ref>Pulleyblank, Leslie and Gardiner, pp. 71–79.</ref><ref>Yü, pp. 460–461.</ref><ref>De Crespigny, p. 600.</ref> In addition to [[Roman Republic|Republican]]-era [[Roman glass]]wares found at [[Guangzhou]] along the [[South China Sea]],<ref>An, 83.</ref> Roman golden medallions made during the reign of Antoninus and perhaps even Marcus have been found at [[Óc Eo]], [[Vietnam]], then part of the [[Kingdom of Funan]] near the Chinese province of [[Jiaozhi]] (in northern Vietnam). This may have been the port city of [[Kattigara]], described by [[Ptolemy]] (c. 150) as being visited by a Greek sailor named Alexander and lying beyond the [[Golden Chersonese]] (i.e. [[Malay Peninsula]]).<ref name='young 2001 pp. 29-30'>Young, pp. 29–30.</ref><ref group=note>For further information on [[Óc Eo]], see Osborne, Milton.

The [[Antonine Plague]] started in [[Mesopotamia]] in 165 or 166 at the end of Lucius's campaign against the Parthians. It may have continued into the reign of [[Commodus]]. [[Galen]], who was in Rome when the plague spread to the city in 166,<ref name="auto1">Haas, pp. 1093–1098.</ref> mentioned that "fever, diarrhoea, and inflammation of the pharynx, along with dry or pustular eruptions of the skin after nine days" were among the symptoms.<ref name=murphy>Murphy, Verity.

BBC News, 7 November 2005.</ref> It is believed that the plague was [[smallpox]].<ref name="auto1"/> In the view of historian [[Rafe de Crespigny]], the plagues afflicting the [[Eastern Han]] empire of China during the reigns of [[Emperor Huan of Han]] (r. 146–168) and [[Emperor Ling of Han]] (r. 168–189), which struck in 151, 161, 171, 173, 179, 182, and 185, were perhaps connected to the plague in Rome.<ref>De Crespigny, p. 514.</ref> Raoul McLaughlin writes that the travel of Roman subjects to the Han Chinese court in 166 may have started a new era of Roman–Far East trade. However, it was also a "harbinger of something much more ominous". According to McLaughlin, the disease caused "irreparable" damage to the Roman maritime trade in the [[Indian Ocean]] as proven by the archaeological record spanning from [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]] to [[Indo-Roman relations|India]], as well as significantly decreased [[Roman commerce|Roman commercial]] activity in [[Southeast Asia]].<ref name='mclaughlin 2010 p59-60'>McLaughlin, pp. 59–60.</ref>

But for my part, I admire him all the more for this very reason, that amid unusual and extraordinary difficulties he both survived himself and preserved the empire. Just one thing prevented him from being completely happy, namely, that after rearing and educating his son in the best possible way he was vastly disappointed in him. This matter must be our next topic; for our history now descends from a kingdom of gold to one of iron and rust, as affairs did for the Romans of that day.
:–Dio lxxi. 36.3–4<ref name="Tr. Cary, ad loc"/></blockquote>

Dio adds that from Marcus's first days as counsellor to Antoninus to his final days as emperor of Rome, "he remained the same [person] and did not change in the least."<ref>Dio lxxii. 36, 72.34</ref>

[[Michael Grant (classicist)|Michael Grant]], in ''The Climax of Rome'', writes of Commodus:<ref name='Grant2011'/>
<blockquote>The youth turned out to be very erratic, or at least so anti-traditional that disaster was inevitable. But whether or not Marcus ought to have known this to be so, the rejections of his son's claims in favour of someone else would almost certainly have involved one of the civil wars which were to proliferate so disastrously around future successions.<ref name='Grant2011'>Grant, ''The Climax Of Rome'', p. 15.</ref></blockquote>

==Attitude towards Christians==
In the first two centuries of the Christian era, local Roman officials were largely responsible for the [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|persecution of Christians]]. In the second century, the emperors treated Christianity as a local problem to be dealt with by their subordinates.<ref>Barnes, 'Legislation against the Christians'.</ref> The number and severity of persecutions of Christians in various locations of the empire seemingly increased during the reign of Marcus Aurelius. The extent to which the emperor himself directed, encouraged, or was aware of these persecutions is unclear and much debated by historians.<ref name='McLynn2010295'>McLynn, ''Marcus Aurelius: A Life'', p. 295.</ref> The early Christian apologist [[Justin Martyr]] includes within his [[First Apology of Justin Martyr|First Apology]] (written between AD 140 and 150) a letter from Marcus Aurelius to the Roman Senate (prior to his reign) describing a battlefield incident in which Marcus believed Christian prayer had saved his army from thirst when "water poured from heaven" after which, "immediately we recognized the presence of God." Marcus goes on to request the Senate desist from earlier courses of Christian persecution by Rome.<ref>The First Apology of Justin Martyr, Chapter LXVIII</ref>

==Writings==
{{main|Meditations}}
[[File:MeditationsMarcusAurelius1811.jpg|thumb|First page of the 1811 English translation by [[Richard Graves]]]]
While on campaign between 170 and 180, Marcus wrote his ''[[Meditations]]'' in Greek as a source for his own guidance and self-improvement. The original title of this work, if it had one, is unknown. 'Meditations' – as well as other titles including 'To Himself' – were adopted later. He had a logical mind, and his notes were representative of Stoic philosophy and spirituality. ''Meditations'' is still revered as a literary monument to a government of service and duty. [[George Long (scholar)|George Long]]'s English translation of ''Meditations'' was included in Volume 2 of the ''[[Harvard Classics]]''.  According to Hays, the book was a favourite of [[Christina of Sweden]], [[Frederick the Great]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Matthew Arnold]], and [[Goethe]], and is admired by modern figures such as [[Wen Jiabao]] and [[Bill Clinton]].<ref>Hays, p. xlix.</ref> It has been considered by many commentators to be one of the greatest works of philosophy.<ref name='Collins1973'>Collins, p. 58.</ref>

It is not known how widely Marcus's writings were circulated after his death. There are stray references in the ancient literature to the popularity of his precepts, and [[Julian the Apostate]] was well aware of his reputation as a philosopher, though he does not specifically mention ''Meditations''.<ref>Stertz, p. 434, citing Themistius, ''Oratio'' 6.81; ''HA Cassius'' 3.5; Victor, ''De Caesaribus'' 16.9.</ref> It survived in the scholarly traditions of the Eastern Church, and the first surviving quotes of the book, as well as the first known reference of it by name ('Marcus's writings to himself') are from [[Arethas of Caesarea]] in the 10th century and in the Byzantine [[Suda]] (perhaps inserted by Arethas himself). It was first published in 1558 in Zurich by [[Wilhelm Xylander|Wilhelm Xylander (né Holzmann)]], from a manuscript reportedly lost shortly afterwards.<ref>Hays, pp. xlviii–xlix.</ref> The oldest surviving complete manuscript copy is in the [[Vatican library]] and dates to the 14th century.<ref>Hadot, p. 22.</ref>

==Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius==
{{main|Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius}}
[[File:Marcus Aurelius, aureus, AD 174, RIC III 295.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aureus]] of Marcus Aurelius (AD December 173 – June 174), with his equestrian statue on the reverse. inscription: M. ANTONINVS AVG. TR. P. XXVIII / IMP. VI, CO[N]S III.<ref>Mattingly & Sydenham, ''Roman imperial coinage'', vol. III, p. 236.</ref>|alt=Aureus of Marcus Aurelius]]
The [[Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius]] in Rome is the only Roman equestrian statue which has survived into the modern period.<ref>Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius.</ref> This may be due to it being wrongly identified during the [[Middle Ages]] as a depiction of the [[Christianity in the 4th century|Christian emperor]] [[Constantine the Great]], and spared the destruction which statues of [[pagan]] figures suffered.

[[File:Estàtua_eqüestre_de_Marc_Aureli_(176_dC),_Museu_Capitolí_(Roma)._Vista_general_de_la_sala_d'exposició.jpg|thumb|The original [[Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius]], 2nd century AD, now located in the [[Palazzo dei Conservatori]]]]
Crafted of bronze in {{Circa|175}}, it stands {{cvt|11.6|ft|m}} and is now located in the [[Capitoline Museums]] of Rome. The emperor's hand is outstretched in an act of clemency offered to a bested enemy, while his weary facial expression due to the stress of leading Rome into nearly constant battles perhaps represents a break with the [[Ancient Greek art|classical tradition]] of [[Ancient Greek sculpture|sculpture]].<ref>Kleiner, p. 193.</ref>

==Column of Marcus Aurelius==
{{main|Column of Marcus Aurelius}}
Marcus's [[victory column]], established in Rome either in his last few years of life or after his reign and completed in 193, was built to commemorate his victory over the Sarmatians and Germanic tribes in 176. A spiral of carved [[relief]]s wraps around the column, showing scenes from his military campaigns. A statue of Marcus had stood atop the column but disappeared during the [[Middle Ages]]. It was replaced with a statue of [[Saint Paul]] in 1589 by [[Pope Sixtus V]].<ref>[https://curate.nd.edu/show/ft848p61g5s 'Column of Marcus Aurelius: Overall view, of base and column'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200522142047/https://curate.nd.edu/show/ft848p61g5s |date=22 May 2020 }}. [[University of Notre Dame]], [[Hesburgh Library]]. Accessed 24 November 2018.</ref> The column of Marcus and the [[column of Trajan]] are often compared by scholars given how they are both [[Doric order|Doric]] in style, had a pedestal at the base, had sculpted [[frieze]]s depicting their respective military victories, and a statue on top.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Scenes for Comparison · The Columns of Trajan and Marcus Aurelius · Classics|url=https://classics.sites.grinnell.edu/exhibits/show/columns-exhibit/comparative-sequences|access-date=21 July 2021|website=classics.sites.grinnell.edu}}</ref>

==Legacy and reputation==
[[File:Roman - Portrait of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius - Walters 23215 (cropped).jpg|thumb|A 2nd century [[Roman portraiture|Roman sculpted portrait]] of Marcus Aurelius, which captures the pensive temperament of the philosopher-emperor, now in the [[Walters Art Museum]].]]
Marcus acquired the reputation of a [[philosopher king]] within his lifetime, and the title would remain after his death; both Dio and the biographer call him "the philosopher".<ref>''HA Marcus'' i. 1, xxvii. 7; Dio lxxi. 1.1; James Francis, ''Subversive Virtue: Asceticism and Authority in the Second-Century Pagan World'' (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1995), 21 n. 1.</ref><ref>Mark, Joshua. [https://www.worldhistory.org/article/174/marcus-aurelius-platos-philosopher-king/ 'Marcus Aurelius: Plato's Philosopher King']. ''World History Encyclopedia''. 8 May 2018.</ref> Christians such as [[Justin Martyr]], [[Athenagoras of Athens|Athenagoras]], and [[Eusebius]] also gave him the title.<ref>Francis, p. 21 n.1, citing Justin, ''1 Apologia'' 1; Athenagoras, ''Leg''. 1; Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 4.26.9–11.</ref> The latter went so far as to call him "more philanthropic and philosophic" than Antoninus and Hadrian, and set him against the persecuting emperors Domitian and Nero to make the contrast bolder.<ref>Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 4.26.9–11, qtd. and tr. Francis, 21 n. 1.</ref>

The historian Herodian wrote:<blockquote>Alone of the emperors, he gave proof of his learning not by mere words or knowledge of philosophical doctrines but by his blameless character and temperate way of life.<ref>Herodian, ''Ab Excessu Divi Marci'' i.2.4, tr. Echols.</ref></blockquote>

[[Iain King]] explains that Marcus's legacy was tragic: <blockquote>[The emperor's] Stoic philosophy – which is about self-restraint, duty, and respect for others – was so abjectly abandoned by the imperial line he anointed on his death.<ref>Thinkers at War.</ref></blockquote>
