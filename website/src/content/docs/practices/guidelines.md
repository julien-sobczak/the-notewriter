title: Guidelines
---


After reading several planning/productivity/note-taking/journaling systems, I concluded the motivations (and principles) are always similar. Everybody has goals to achieve by completing tasks that requires knowledge and insights.

In addition, no system is useful when working on the wrong thing. Therefore, planning and reflection must be integrated to any workflow.

This page regroups the best ideas in my readings and the lessons I learned the hard way.


## Notes Collecting

**What to put into your second brain? Everything that resonates with you**. Manage your notes like your music playlist. You probably don't listen music people think you should but the one that makes you feel special.


## Notes Writing

### Name your tasks in `TODO` notes after a verb

**Action requires a verb**. The verb prompts for completion and helps in estimating the task.

Examples:
* "Laundry" (ü§∑) vs "Start a load of laundry" (5 minutes üí™)
* "Breakfast with parents" (ü§∑) vs "Call parents to plan breakfast date" (5 minutes üí™)

Make sure to use the right verb! (_Contact Bob üëé vs Email/Phone Bob üëç_)

(Inspiration: _To-Do List Formula_, by Damon Zahariades)


## Notes Refining

### Use labels to find notes easily

Examples:

* Use labels `#low-energy`, `#low-attention` to identify tasks best done outside your prime zone, when working on your much challenging tasks is not ideal. Using separate labels is preferable to a label `#low-motivation` since both concepts are not identical.

(Inspiration: _The Productivity Project_, by Chris Bailey)


## Use schemas to impose minimal structure over notes

_The NoteWriter_ is a thinking tool, not an archival tool. The only motivation to keep your notes is to use them later to act. Schemas are useful to ensure your notes stay maintainable.

:::caution

Schemas must be used sparingly. You must find the right balance between chaos and rigidity, i.e., between notes that are hard to use (or find) and notes that are too cumbersome to write.

## Notes Organization


### Classify information

_The NoteWriter_ uses files and directories to organize notes, which means you can very quickly end up with a completely disorganized notebook üòì.

The best system I encountered is the PARA system, introduce by Tiago Forte. Only a few categories is enough to encompass all the information in your life:

* **P**roject: Short-term efforts in your work or life
* **A**rea: Long-term responsabilities (work, health, home, family, ...)
* **R**esource: Topics that may be useful in the future (ex: to advance projects)
* **A**rchive: Inactive items from above categories (simply delete them if your repository is backed by Git)

I use a [modified version](./my-workflow.md) of this system.

:::caution

Find the right balance when organizing your notes:

* Too much organization = adding new notes is cumbersome
* Not enough organization = searching notes is painful

:::


## Use Common Notes

* Create a "TODO: Maintenance List" note with `#low-energy`, `#low-attention` tasks you can delay and bulk once per week.
* Create an "Reference: Accomplishments List" note with achievements to remind you how much productive you are.
