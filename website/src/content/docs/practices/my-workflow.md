title: My Workflow

* I collect my thoughs using Google Keep on my phone (Google Keep is one the only three applications present on my home screen along with Calm and Anki).
* I collect notes during my readings using Google Keep (by entering them manually or taking a screenshot) to annotate them with comments (why I found them interesting? Why it resonates in me?), something not possible when highlighting using my Koko reader.
* I review my notes during a 1-hour weekly session every Friday where the goals are multiple: empty my Google Keep notes taken the last week by editing them along my existing notes, review my weekly objectives and plan the next week.
* I organize my notes using a variant of the PARA system:
