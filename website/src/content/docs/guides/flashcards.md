title: Flashcards
---


:::important

Flashcards can (for now) only be studied using _The NoteWriter Nomad_, which means you must configure a [remote](./remote.md).

:::

## Syntax

Flashcards are special notes using an additional syntax. The front and the back cards must be separated by `---`.

Ex:

```md
## Flashcard: GTD's creator

**Who** created GTD?

---

David Allen
```

## Algorithm

The algorithm is heavily inspired by [Anki SM-2 variant](https://www.juliensobczak.com/inspect/2022/05/30/anki-srs.html).

**TODO**
