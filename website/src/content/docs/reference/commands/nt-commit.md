title: "nt commit"

## Name

`nt commit` â€” Record changes to the repository.

## Synopsis

```
Usage:
  nt commit [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help             help for commit
  -m, --message string   commit message
```

## Description

Create a new commit containing the current contents of the staging area.

The content to be committed can be specified by using `nt add` to incrementally "add" changes to the index before using the `commit` command (Note: even modified files must be "added").


## Examples

When recording your own work, the contents of modified files in your working tree are temporarily stored to a staging area called the "index" with `nt add`. After building the state to be committed incrementally, `nt commit` is used to record what has been staged so far. This is the most basic form of the command. An example:

```shell
$ edit hello.md
$ nt add hello.md
$ nt commit
```

A commit doesn't have an author or a message. Use Git to version your files and preserve the history.
