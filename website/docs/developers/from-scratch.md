# From Scratch

The goal of this document is to write a basic version of _The NoteTaker_ to emphasize the core abstractions and the main logic.

:::info

We will implement a basic version supporting only the commands `nt add` and `nt commit`, and only the objects `File` and `Note` (no flashcards, medias, etc.).

The source code is available in this same repository under the directory `cmd/nt-lite/`.
