# Linter

The linter enforces rules on your notes to ensure their syntax is consistent and makes easy to find them later. It's particularly interesting as your collection of notes grows over time.

## Configuration

The linter reads its configuration from the YAML file `.nt/lint`. No file exists by default. Ex:

```yaml
rules:
- name: min-lines-between-notes
  args: [2]
- name: no-free-note
  includes:
  - references/
- name: no-dangling-media
- name: no-dead-wikilink
```

Rules are declared under the attribute `rules`. Some rules accept arguments using the attribute `args` (array of primitive values) and all rules can be restricted to apply on a subset of your notes using the attribute `includes` (array of glob path expressions).


## Rules

| Rule  | Description  | Arguments  |
|---|---|---|
| `no-duplicate-note-title` | Enforce no duplicate between note titles inside the same file | - |
| `min-lines-between-notes` | Enforce a minimum number of lines between notes | <ul><li><code>int</code> The number of lines</li></ul> |
|	`max-lines-between-notes` | Enforce a maximum number of lines between notes | <ul><li><code>int</code> The number of lines</li></ul> |
|	`note-title-match` | Enforce a consistent naming for notes | <ul><li><code>string</code> A Golang regex</li></ul> |
|	`no-free-note` | Forbid untyped notes | - |
|	`no-dangling-media` | Path to media files must exist | - |
|	`no-dead-wikilink` | Links between notes must exist | - |
|	`no-extension-wikilink` | No extension in wikilinks | - |
|	`no-ambiguous-wikilink` | No ambiguity in wikilinks | - |
|	`require-quote-tag` | At least one tag on quotes (must match the optional pattern) | <ul><li><code>string</code> A regex that must match all accepted tags on quotes</li></ul> |
|	`check-attribute` | Attributes must satisfy their schema if defined (see below) | - |

`@author: Marcus Aurelius`

You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think.
```

:::tip

Use the rule `check-attribute` to ensure all values are valid and consistent between notes.

:::

## Schemas

Schemas are used to defined attributes and must follow this structure:

```yaml title=.nt/lint
schemas:

- name: Quotes          # A name used when reporting violations
  kind: quote           # Restriction on the note kinds
  path: references      # Restriction on the note path (glob pattern)
  attributes:           # Define a list of attributes
    - name: name        # The attribute name
      aliases: [author] # Optional aliases for the attribute name
      type: string      # One of: array, string (default), boolean, number, object
      required: true    # Mandatory? (default: false)
      inherit: true     # Attribute is inheritable by sub-notes? (default: true)
```

Default schemas (important for the inner working of the application) are predefined:

```yaml
schemas:

  - name: Hooks
    attributes:
    - name: hook
      type: array
      inherit: false

  - name: Tags
    attributes:
      - name: tags
        type: array

  - name: Relations
    attributes:
      - name: source
        inherit: false
      - name: references
        type: array
      - name: inspirations
        type: array
```

Declaring attributes as `array` is convenient as value will automatically be appended to existing values:

```md
---
tags: life # Same as tags: [life]
---

# A Note

`@tag: life-changing`

This note will have the tags `#life` and `#life-changing`.
```

:::caution

Schemas are only enforced when enabling the rule `check-attribute`.
