# Why

**TODO** complete


**I created _The NoteWriter_ to keep my notes in a safe place for a very long time.** I was tired of moving my notes when a popular application was dying and a new one was rising. I was tired of putting my notes on commercial products (and OSS products with a commercial offering for the product to last is not acceptable to me neither). I was tired of using different tools for different kinds of notes (FOAM + Anki). And I had ideas for new features that was missing in my previous toolkit.

I created _The NoteWriter_ to match my requirements, assembled from many years passed strugling with my note-taking workflow

_The NoteWriter_ source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/julien-sobczak/the-notewriter). You probably should not use it as long as I am the only contributor. I didn't publish it to attract contributors although contributions are welcome. I publish it to share my workflow to inspire others and iterate on current solutions that are too limited in my opinion.

I wanted to create the note-taking application that will reuse most of my knowledge. I can edit my notes using my favorite IDE, manage them using my terminal, and use it on all my device without restrictions or additional subscriptions.

I wrote my notes for the long time. I need a tool to preserve them for a long time. Even OSS solutions can guarantee it. The only options are to maintain your own tool and/or rely on a tool with a true community of contributors.
